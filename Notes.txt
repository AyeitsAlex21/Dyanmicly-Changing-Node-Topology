pdf: is data center is p2p setting

attack-context: change path between server and client dynamicly.

NS3, Omnet-pp: Network simulator?

Problem: unless dynamicly switch application cannot scale application add capacity. Need to show scenarios where static breaks 
then show my solution which supports hella more users, it happens under the hood so great.

GOAL: look at preformance and scalibility, previous config and preformance gigabits per second, then get better preformance in diff config
ONS.pdf: figure 3

search for benchmarks that stress the network bandwidth, or throughput.
iper3: application?
